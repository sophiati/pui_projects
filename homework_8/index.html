      <h3>Overview of Methodologies</h3>
      <p>
        Below are some examples of how the different methodologies break down
        ranging from attitudinal (testing users' perceptions) to behavioral
        (understanding users' actions) and from what they seek to understand
        from "What a user is doing" and "Why they are doing it"

                  Interviews are most suitable for exploratory research at the
                  beginning of a research project where the problem space needs
                  to be further defined. Because of the self-report bias that
                  comes with interviews, it is best when this method can be
                  triangulated with other methods that offer more insight into
                  user behaviors. Interviews can be either structured with a set
                  list of questions or unstructured, where the interviewer comes
                  with a list of themes or topics to guide the conversation, but
                  leaves room for deeper probing.

                    there subsets of users? Aim for 4-8 interviewees within each
                    subset or category that you identify.

                  <li>
                    <span class="list-start">Develop an interview guide.</span
                    >For semi-structured interviews, begin by outlining topics
                    or themes you want to explore with the participant. Once
                    you’ve narrowed down 3-4 themes, draft 3-6 questions for
                    each theme. Don’t forget to add introduction and conclusion
                    sections to your interview guide where you give an overview
                    of the project, ask for consent, and wrap-up the
                    conversation.

                    with your interview guide handy and a system for taking
                    notes. Use a software that will record audio and/or video of
                    the conversation (after receiving participant consent to be
                    recorded). It is best to conduct interviews with a teammate
                    where one person can moderate and the other can capture
                    notes.

                  Ethnography involves semi-structured observation in the
                  exploratory phase of the design process. Observing users in
                  their natural environments is ideal to get an honest
                  understanding of users’ behaviors. Generally, ethnographic
                  methods enable researchers to observe with an open mind, but
                  they may come with certain items they are looking for to
                  structure the process to codify certain behaviors.

                  Contextual inquiry is an immersive method, which allows the
                  researcher to probe while also observing the participant in
                  the context in which they typically perform the activity they
                  want to study. Unlike a typical interview where the
                  interviewer is moderating, contextual inquiry adopts a
                  master/apprentice model where the interviewee is the master
                  and the interviewer is the apprentice. This enables the
                  interviewer to truly be immersed in the user’s daily routine,
                  learning from the “master” about how they do things while
                  observing and asking probing questions.

                    Note any exploratory questions you are interested in asking
                    about. Include a conclusion to wrap-up the session.

                  Diary studies are beneficial for capturing information from
                  users across a longer period of time, sampling their thoughts,
                  feelings, and behaviors at key moments. Traditionally, diary
                  studies have involved sending participants diaries with
                  activities written in them for the participant to complete at
                  certain points throughout their days. Each page entry in the
                  diary is guided with a question or prompt, and creativity is
                  encouraged for participants to include images, drawing, or
                  text. A reflection space is also typically included.

                  With the rise of digital tools, many platforms now exist to
                  support conducting diary studies online. These enable the
                  researcher to set up activities for a user and release new
                  prompts each day or week for the duration of the study. Users
                  can record audio and video of certain moments, upload images,
                  and respond to tasks. Some of these platforms include

                    result in attrition over time. Consider these aspects when
                    deciding how many users to recruit.

                    focus on at which point during the study. Also determine

                    which parts of the duration of the study, craft activities
                    related to each topic. For each entry, make sure to start
                    with a guide or prompt for the user and balance how
                    time-intensive tasks are for each day. Include any

                  Competitive analysis is an exploratory research method that
                  enables researchers to keep track of competition’s business
                  activity. When exploring a new problem space, research teams
                  can see what similar products or services currently exist. To
                  understand their strengths and weaknesses, researchers can
                  conduct usability tests or other research methods using
                  competitor tools to better gauge where their competition
                  stands.

                  Card sorting is beneficial when trying to understand users’
                  comprehension and expected organization of content. While the
                  exact categories and format of card sorting may vary depending
                  on the research question, card sorting involves providing
                  users with many cards containing concepts, terms, or features
                  and asking them to sort them into categories. Card sorts can
                  either be structured, where the categories are predefined by
                  the researcher, or unstructured, where participants can label
                  categories for each grouping of cards as they see fit. This
                  method is often used when determining the navigation of a
                  website or application, the organization of content on a site,
                  or prioritizing hierarchy of features. Many digital tools now
                  enable card sorting such as

                  Focus groups are less commonly used as a user research method
                  as participants in focus groups can be susceptible to
                  groupthink, where they change their real views to match what
                  the rest of the crowd thinks or says. Focus groups are a
                  successful user research method for studying user experience
                  with activities typically performed or experienced in group
                  settings such as redesigning a workplace environment used by
                  many employees. This method can also be used by market
                  researchers to understand opinions or perceptions of a group
                  potentially about a brand or product.

                  Taken from its real-life counterpart, speed dating is a method
                  where researchers rapidly test design opportunities with
                  potential users. Users are exposed in rapid succession to
                  potential design ideas in the form of storyboards or simulated
                  environments to validate the need that the proposed concepts
                  solve. This method is typically used after conducting other
                  contextual field methods and beginning to ideate around
                  potential design opportunities.

                  Think aloud protocol is a technique that can be used in a
                  range of user research methods including usability testing,
                  contextual inquiries, and card sorting. The technique involves
                  asking users to think aloud as they complete a task or
                  activity whether that task was prompted by the moderator as in
                  a usability test or is one they are doing organically as in a
                  contextual inquiry.

                  A method which employs the think aloud protocol, usability
                  testing occurs later in the design process after a working
                  prototype has been developed. Usability testing sessions are
                  one-on-one engagements where participants are asking to use an
                  interface to complete a series of tasks and think aloud while
                  doing so. The moderator may ask probing follow-up questions.
                  This method helps design teams identify what might be
                  delightful, confusing, or frustrating about a design before
                  the product is formally launched.

                  A form of digital trace data, web analytics are used to
                  capture real quantitative information about how users are
                  interacting with a specific product, website, or service.

                  informs product teams about potential business issues or

                  the site.

                  Surveys are a way to collect information from a larger sample
                  of participants. Because of their ability to collect large
                  amounts of data in a short amount of time, they are an
                  efficient tool. Unlike other self-report methods such as
                  interviews, surveys enable the collection of attitudinal
                  information from a broader and more diverse range of
                  participants. However, they often do not enable researchers to
                  answer questions about why they answered a certain way and ask
                  follow-up questions. Popular platforms for deploying surveys
                  range in sophistication with
                  <a href="docs.google.com/forms">Google Forms</a> and
                  <a href="https://forms.office.com/">Microsoft Forms</a>
                  providing relatively simple functionality, but available to
                  all email account holders, to
                  <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a>,
                  which provides a medium amount of functionality, and
                  <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>, which is
                  highly sophisticated and customizable.

                    <span class="list-start">Develop the survey. </span>Define
                    key topics you hope to explore in your survey to break the
                    survey into sections. Within each topic, identify tangible
                    survey questions and intended formats (i.e. radio buttons,
                    sliders, rating buttons, dropdowns, matrices, etc.) to ask
                    respondents. Avoid too many free response questions as they
                    lead to survey fatigue and open-ended questions, which will
                    make data analysis difficult later on.
